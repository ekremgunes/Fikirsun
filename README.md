## 📣 Developer Notes

Hi devs 😥!

Firstly nice to see you!If you wanna see frontend scripts you look my Blog-WEBUI repo.


EN: The biggest challenge of the project was trying to rush the development of the backend. I worked alone for only 1-2 months for this extensive project. As a result, although a beautiful website emerged, I couldn't utilize the technologies and techniques I knew to their fullest extent. For those who wish to further develop the project, you can access some of my notes in dev.txt. Enjoy!


TR: Projenin en büyük sorunu backendin hızla yetiştirilmeye çalışılmasıydı bu geniş proje için yalnızca 1-2 ay tek başıma çalıştım . Sonuç olarak ortaya güzel bir site çıkmış olsa dahi bildiğim teknikleri ve teknolojileri kullanamadım .Geliştirmek isteyenler için aldığım bazı notlara dev.txt üzerinden ulaşabilirsiniz iyi eğlenceler !
